    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this Notebook is to demonstrate how to convert Kubios Cloud demo 2 Python code to JavaScript. Bing Copilot is used to convert the Python code snippets to JavaScript. **Note, the code has not been tested, but it works as starting point for writing your own backend code.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The original Python code snippets are based on the Kubioscloud example for authorization and Kubios Cloud API reference (see the References).\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to use this Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "- Copy the codes to your own coding environment and modify and verify them.\n",
    "- For USERNAME and PASSWORD use the Kubios HRV application username and password.\n",
    "- You can use also the same username and password to login into the Kubios Cloud API.\n",
    "- In addition, you need CLIENT_ID to read the data from Kubioscloud.\n",
    "- Some of the following code snippets needs info/data from the previous steps, so check carefully how the information is extracted from the JSON data-structures and entered to the next code.\n",
    "- At the end you should have all your analysis and raw data written into JSON and CSV files.\n",
    "\n",

    "```javascript\n",
    "// Python's 'base64' can be replaced with 'Buffer' in Node.js\n",
    "// No need to import 'logging' in JavaScript, you can use console.log()\n",
    "// Python's 're' can be replaced with JavaScript's built-in RegExp\n",
    "// Python's 'uuid' can be replaced with 'uuid' in Node.js\n",
    "// Python's 'pprint' can be replaced with 'console.log()' in JavaScript\n",
    "// Python's 'requests' can be replaced with 'axios' in Node.js\n",
    "// Python's 'matplotlib.pyplot' doesn't have a direct equivalent in JavaScript\n",

    "\n",
    "Please note that JavaScript (especially in the browser) doesn't have direct equivalents for some Python libraries like `matplotlib` and `numpy`. For complex numerical computations and plotting in JavaScript, you might need to look into specific libraries or use a combination of libraries. Also, the code above is for a Node.js environment, and it may vary if you're working in a different JavaScript environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember to install the necessary npm packages if you're working in a Node.js environment. You can do this by running `npm install <package-name>` in your terminal. For example, `npm install axios uuid url`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, please note that the conversion of code from one language to another is not always straightforward and may require understanding of the logic and functionality you want to implement. The provided JavaScript code is just for importing similar libraries and may not work exactly the same way as in Python. It's always recommended to understand the functionality of each library and find the best equivalent in the target language."

In JavaScript, all the constants are block-scoped, they can only be accessed within the block they were declared. If you need to change the value later in your code, you can use `let` instead of `const`. Also, JavaScript uses semicolons at the end of each statement."
